The HTML spec for sequents is as follows:
    Each tree will be represented by a tree class which will act as a
    grid container for the leaves (cells). The grid's height will be 
    twice the height of the proof tree (i.e. the base sequent's 
    complexity) plus one and its width will (TBD).

    Each tree will have its own class, defining grid-template-areas in
    accordance with the size of the proof tree. Each leaf on that tree
    will also have its own class, with a horizontal bar above it. The
    text in each leaf (cell) will be centered.

    Each tree will be identified by its root, with disallowed 
    characters replaced by numbers (numbers in sequents may have to be
    reserved for this, but we'll see).

    the root
    (A -> B), A; B 
    yields the following classes:
        ._1A_implies_B25_A6_B (the tree, i.e. grid container)
        ._1A_implies_B25_A6_B-f (the root, whose content is just 
        the sequent, f stands for floor for now, this may change)
        ._1A_implies_B25_A6_B-ft (the label for the root, t stands
        for tag, since l (label) is taken)
        ._1A_implies_B25_A6_B-l (the left parent, whose content is 
        equivalent to A; A)
        ._1A_implies_B25_A6_B-lt (label for left parent)
        ._1A_implies_B25_A6_B-r (the right parent, whose content is
        equivalent to B; B)
        ._1A_implies_B25_A6_B-rt (label for right parent)

    To get around reserved characters in css classes, we make the 
    following substitutions:
        - " " -> _
        - "(" -> 1
        - ")" -> 2
        - "<" -> 3
        - ">" -> 4
        - "," -> 5
        - ";" -> 6
    Moreover, because we cannot start with digits or hyphens followed 
    by digits, all classes will begin with an underscore to allow 
    sequens which would begin with parentheses.
    We reserve hyphens for the class identifier. We follow sequents'
    paths from the root by going either left (l), right (r) or neither 
    (m), so that sequents with two parents always have an l and r 
    parent and single-parent sequents have only an m parent. These are 
    placed in the grid-template-areas property of the tree class.

    To clean things up a bit, all trees have two classes, the general
    tree class which defines general formatting for the grid, and the
    sequent specific class which defines only grid-template-areas. 
    Likewise, each cell is made of two classes, one for cell formatting
    and one for the cell's location. Labels have only the class that 
    defines their location in the parent grid.

    Quantifiers are not fully implemented and having more than one name
    instantiated in a tree will cause collisions. I will wait to 
    implement these properly until I have a better handle on how 
    quantifiers should be decomposed.
