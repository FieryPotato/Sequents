# Sequents (WIP)

A spiritual successor to my work in Material Inference. 
I have since learned what a design pattern is and have more thoroughly understood how to write good code.
This reimagines that module as both a command line program and a module on its own, 
with more transparent architecture, a more reasonable interface, and (hopefully) more readable and understandable code.

Development as of 2022-08-23 is still at the stage of recovering previous functionality.
