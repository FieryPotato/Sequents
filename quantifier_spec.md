# Spec for Quantifiers:

Quantified propositions should coexist with sentential propositions.
They share a structure with negations as unary propositions, which is to say
they have a space between their logical content and their propositional content
and do not use parentheses to group them.
    - [symbol/string][variable] [propositional content]

Atoms can be sentential (P, Q, The long moon creeps over the horizon, etc.) or
first-order, which are displayed as single words or letters followed by one or
more lowercase letters.

## Universal
- symbol: ∀ (U+2200)
- string: forall

## Existential
- symbol: ∃ (U+2203)
- string: exists
